Santander Value Prediction Challenge
Project summary
According to Epsilon research, 80% of customers are more likely to do business with a company if it provides personalized service. Banking is no exception. The digitalization of everyday lives means that customers expect services to be delivered in a personalized and timely manner, often before they have even realized they need the service.

Santander Group aims to go a step beyond providing a customer with financial service and intends to determine the amount or value of the customer's transaction. The primary focus is on Digital Delivery of Financial Services, reinforcing distribution and the overall customer experience in the new digital environment. The company strives to achieve it by using Big Data Analytics with platforms to leverage financial and non-financial information. That means anticipating customer needs in a more concrete, but also simple and personal way.

With so many choices for financial services, this need is greater now than ever before. This is a first step that Santander strives to nail in order to personalize their services at scale.

Project Objectives:

Anticipate customer needs
Provide personalized banking
Identify value of transactions for each potential customer
Santander Group wants to predict the value of future customer transactions (target column) in the test set with the minimal error. The evaluation metric for this project is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error.

To solve that challenge, we are planning to follow CRISP-DM outline:

Perform preprocessing and EDA.
Validate the provided partition of the available data into a training set and a test set.
Build a data mining model using the training set data. We are planning to use 2 supervised (regression decision tree vs linear regression) methods and compare the results.
Evaluate the data mining model using the test set data and achieve the minimal error across methods.
Determine whether all the facets of the objective have been addressed or there are subtler interesting areas.
Make conclusions about the model results and produce the report for deployment.
